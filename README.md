## About this program<a name="about"></a>

What you're about to see is a simple memory game created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The objective of this game is to match 8 sets of cards by the icons that will appear each time a card is clicked. 

At the beginning of each play session the cards are placed face-down so that these icons cannot be seen, so a bit of guesswork will be required at the very start. To ensure no two games are ever the same, the cards are randomized each time the program is reset.

## Instructions<a name="instructions"></a>

1. The game--and timer--will start once any card on the screen is clicked
2. Once a card has been clicked, it will 'flip' over to reveal an icon
3. Your challenge is to find the matching card to form a pair. Once you've matched all 4 pairs, the game will end

## Scoring<a name="scoring"></a>

1. Each time a card is clicked, the move counter will increment by 1
2. Your star level (up to a total of 3) will start to drop if too many moves are made in a single session
3. Your objective, should you choose to accept it, is to complete the game with as high a star rating as possible
4. For an added challenge, see if you can beat your previous time while maintaining a high star level
